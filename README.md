## Here are the list of small changes that I make to android ROM

* Header and a Brief description (should match package.json)
* Example (if applicable)
* Motivation (if applicable)
* API Documentation: _This will likely vary considerably from library to library._
* Installation
* Tests
* Contributors
* License

**Bonus Points**

1. The file is named exactly `README.md` (not `ReadMe.md`, or `README`)
2. The license file is named exactly `LICENSE` (not `MIT-LICENSE`, or `license`)
3. MIT or Apache or GPL or whatever the source it from.
